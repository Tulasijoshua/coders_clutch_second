        question: `What Should I Consider When Selecting An MVP Software Development Company?`,
        answer: `Look for a team that moves fast and builds smart. Prioritize experience with MVPs, a solid understanding of 
                    your domain and transparent communication. Bonus points if they challenge your ideasâ€”in a good way.`,
    },
    {
        id: "2",
        question: `How long does it take to develop MVP software?`,
        answer: `Typically, an MVP takes 6 to 12 weeks, depending on complexity and scope. Our goal is to get your idea to market 
                    fast, without cutting corners or losing sleep over features no one asked for (yet).`,
    },
    {
        id: "3",
        question: `What are the examples of famous applications that started with an MVP?`,
        answer: `Big names like Airbnb, Facebook, Dropbox, and Uber all launched MVPs first. Simple, functional, and 
                    focused; they tested the waters before diving into full-blown product development.`,
    },
    {
        id: "4",
        question: `Can I upgrade my MVP to a full-fledged product?`,
        answer: `Absolutely. Your MVP is the launchpad. Once validated, we can scale it into a full-featured, robust 
                    product; adding new features, refining performance, and prepping it for long-term growth.`,
